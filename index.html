<h1>Thinking about Games</h1>


<h2>Thinking about Games</h2>
    <p>A game is a structured type of play usually undertaken for entertainment or fun and  sometimes used as an educational tool. Many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or video games) or art (such as games involving an artistic layout such as mahjong, solitaire, or some video games). 
         </p>
         <p>There are many types of games; popular formats include board games, video games, online games, and card games. Games can be played in a variety of circumstances, and some can be played even without any materials or company. Games can be played either for enjoyment or for competition; they can be played alone or in teams; they can be played offline or online </p>
         <p >All games must have a challenge and a structure; barring certain exceptions like sandbox games, all games also have an objective. Multiplayer games also include interaction between two or more players. Not all forms of play are considered games; toys and puzzles, for instance, are not games, as they do not have a structure. </p>
       
       
  <h2> Where do they originate?</h2>
     <p>  The history of games dates to the ancient human past. Games are an integral part of all cultures and are one of the oldest forms of human social interaction. Games are formalized expressions of play which allow people to go beyond immediate imagination and direct physical activity. Common features of games include uncertainty of outcome, agreed upon rules, competition, separate place and time, elements of fiction, elements of chance, prescribed goals and personal enjoyment. </p>

<h2> What's the first Story behind the first game?</h2>
     <p> In October 1958, Physicist William Higinbotham created what is thought to be the first video game. It was a very simple tennis game, like the classic 1970s video game Pong, and it was quite a hit at a Brookhaven National Laboratory open house. In 1948 he joined Brookhaven National Laboratory’s instrumentation group. He served as head of that group from 1951 to 1968. </p>
